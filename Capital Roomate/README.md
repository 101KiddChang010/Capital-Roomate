-A web application that's uncompleted, static and non functional.
-Contributors list: Kidd Chang

## Overview of what was done
-I approached the problem by thinking about what could be done at home to improve life at home.
-HTML, CSS, VUE, JS, Visual Studio code.
-The work I completed was just the front end framework of the website.
-The outcome was an incomplete web application.

## Navigating the repo
-All the data will be found in the Capital Roomate file
-You can reproduce the output of the hack by creating a simple html website with some css.
