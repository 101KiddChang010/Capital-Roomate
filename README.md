# Project Information

-A web application that's uncompleted, static and non functional. <br />
-Contributors list: Kidd Chang <br />

## Overview of what was done
-I approached the problem by thinking about what could be done at home to improve life at home. <br />
-HTML, CSS, VUE, JS, Visual Studio code. <br />
-The work I completed was just the front end framework of the website. <br />
-The outcome was an incomplete web application. <br />

## Navigating the repo
-All the data will be found in the Capital Roomate file. <br />
-The main file with data will be the "App.vue" file. <br />
-The most important data will be the readme file in the "capital-roomate" folder which will explain how to run the program. <br />
-You can reproduce the output of the hack by creating a simple html website with some css. <br />

### Explaination of most files in Capital Roomate
-All the files in the "capital-roomate" file are accomodating files for the project. <br />
-The folder "capital-roomate/src" is the main file to run the program and contains all the assets and components. <br />
-The folder "capital-roomate/public" just contains an icon and the index. <br />
-The folder "capital-roomate/.vscode" has a single supporting file used for visual studio code if you use visual studio code. <br />
