## Overview of what was done

-HTML, CSS, VUE, JS, Visual Studio code. <br />
-The work I completed was just the front end framework of the website. <br />
-The outcome was an incomplete web application. <br />

## Navigating the repo
-All the data will be found in the Capital Roomate file. <br />
-You can reproduce the output of the hack by creating a simple html website with some css. <br />
